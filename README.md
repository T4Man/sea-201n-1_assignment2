Assignment 2: Guessing Games
These are two simple guessing games. In addition to the HTML page there are external CSS and JS pages.
You'll need all three for the program to operate correctly.
Good luck!

Here's a joke. Good or bad? You decide.

Two cannibals are eating a clown. One cannibal looks at the other and says,
"Does this taste funny to you?"

That bad huh? Ok, here's another.

A pirate walks into a bar with the wheel of his ship stuffed into his pants.
The bartender looks at the wheel and says, “That looks mighty uncomfortable!”
To which the pirate replies, “ARRRGH… it’s drivin’ me nuts!”

Oh yeah!? Well, if I had a day job maybe I WOULD keep it!
